# Hello. 
This is a google map react application using redux-saga.
Have a nice day :)

## Remaining Issues
- deletion of input text using quick button is slow and sometime not functioning
- deletion on search history which cause store state change won't trigger page to re-render
- duplication search still display inside history list
- CSS refractoring
